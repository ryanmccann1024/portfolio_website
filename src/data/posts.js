<p>
  Welcome to the blog. Iâ€™m Ryan McCann, a PhD student in Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. I'm currently researching how to apply artificial intelligence to optimize large-scale optical networks.
</p>

<p>
  But here's the part that usually gets a double-take: I'm doing all of this from Colombia.
</p>

<h2>Why Iâ€™m Here</h2>

<p>
  There are a few reasons. First: cost of living. If youâ€™ve ever lived on a PhD stipend in Massachusetts, you know the math doesnâ€™t always work. Rent, food, transportation, it adds up fast. By contrast, living in Colombia allows me to comfortably support myself while staying focused on research.
</p>

<p>
  Second: lifestyle. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated with Latin American culture. Iâ€™ve studied Spanish for years and now speak it fluently (C1). My girlfriend is here, and Iâ€™ve found community, routine, and inspiration in this country, all without sacrificing academic rigor.
</p>

<p>
  And third: my program is fully remote. I still travel back to the U.S. to present at conferences or speak at my university, but day-to-day, Iâ€™m able to contribute meaningfully from anywhere with a decent internet connection.
</p>

<h2>Why I Built This Blog</h2>

<p>
  I built this blog to share the journey, not just the polished version of academic life, but the reality of researching, building, and learning while living outside the usual mold.
</p>

<p>
  Iâ€™ll use this space to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Talk openly about the PhD experience, the good, the hard, and the unexpected</li>
  <li>Share the technical work Iâ€™m doing in AI and optical networking</li>
  <li>Explain how I stay up to date with new research without burning out</li>
  <li>Talk about tools, productivity systems, and mindsets that help me stay afloat</li>
  <li>Explore what happens next, after the PhD, after this chapter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who This Blog Is For</h2>

<p>
  Maybe youâ€™re a student thinking about grad school. Maybe you're already in it. Maybe you're just curious how someone ended up writing code for neural networks while sipping coffee in MedellÃ­n.
</p>

<p>
  Either way, I hope you find something useful here.
</p>

<h2>Whatâ€™s Next</h2>

<p>
  In upcoming posts, Iâ€™ll show how I structure my time, how I track research trends (without doomscrolling), and how Iâ€™ve learned to work independently while staying deeply connected to a global community of engineers and researchers.
</p>

<p>
  If any of that sounds interesting, stick around. This blog will grow with me.
